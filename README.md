# Simple Interest Calculator ğŸ“ˆ

This is a simple interest calculator that computes the interest based on the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Formula

Simple Interest = P * T *  R

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount. ğŸ’°
- \( T \) is the time period in years. ğŸ“…
- \( R \) is the annual rate of interest. ğŸ“ˆ

## Input
- \( P \): Principal amount (ğŸ’°)
- \( T \): Time period in years (ğŸ“…)
- \( R \): Annual rate of interest (ğŸ“ˆ)

## Output
- Simple Interest: The interest calculated using the formula above (ğŸ’µ)
